# Vṛthā (वृथा) - Advanced Vṛthā VAPT Framework v2.0

![Vrtha Banner](utils/banner.py)

> **"Offensive Excellence for Defensive Strength"**
> 
> Vṛthā is a production-grade, AI-powered automation framework designed for comprehensive Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) of WordPress environments. It chains industry-leading security tools with a sophisticated **Red Team AI Analyst** to deliver actionable intelligence, not just raw logs.

---

## 🌟 Why Vṛthā?

Traditional scanners often leave security professionals with mountains of disconnected logs. Vṛthā solves this by integrating:
- **Red Team AI Analyst**: A custom engine (`sec_ai`) that correlates findings and generates Exploit PoCs.
- **Contextual Intelligence**: It understands that an outdated plugin + a sensitive secret + an exposed route = a critical attack path.
- **Automated Workflow**: From reconnaissance to professional reporting in a single command.

## 🔥 Key Features

### 🕵️ Comprehensive Reconnaissance
- **Optimized Subdomain Enumeration**: Chaining `subfinder`, `amass`, and `crt.sh`.
- **Intelligent Tech Detection**: Blazing fast fingerprinting using the `httpx` Wappalyzer engine (replaces WhatWeb).
- **DNS Security Analysis**: Targeted identification of SPF/DMARC/MX misconfigurations.

### 🧠 Red Team AI Analyst (`sec_ai`)
- **Advanced Persona**: Operates as a Senior Penetration Tester with 15+ years of experience.
- **Professional Reporting**: Generates high-quality **PDF reports** (branded and confidentiality-labeled).
- **Anti-Hallucination**: Strictly evidence-based reporting using actual scan data.
- **Exploit Reasoning**: Generates valid Python/Bash PoCs and calculates precise **CVSS v3.1** scores.

### 🛡️ Deep Discovery & Vulnerability Scanning
- **Authenticated Scans**: New support for `--cookie` based testing in `main.sh`.
- **Intelligent Fuzzing**: Technology-aware wordlist selection based on `httpx` fingerprints.
- **Plugin Static Analysis (SAST)**: Automated analysis of identified plugin source code for dangerous PHP sinks.
- **Deep Secrets Scraping**: Enhanced patterns for service keys (Twilio, Firebase, etc.) and JS endpoints.
